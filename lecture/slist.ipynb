    "- store a linear sequence of elements of same type and size;\n",

    "Any linear *sequence* needs to maintain some kind of *logical order* of their elements, so that we can, say, find the k<sup>th</sup> element.\n",

    "(Chain of friends? Chain of clues? In these examples, we only know where the current element is, but as long as each element knows the next one, we are fine.)\n",

    "The above code looks a bit messy because it has to check if `head` is null every time when it tries to access any node on the SLL. This kind of problems in algorithm implementation can often be fixed with a little tweak in the underlying data structure. If we don't want to check if `head == null`, we make sure it's not, by adding a *dummy head*. The following is a diagram of SLL's without and with a dummy head:"

    "- *Strictly* follow the order of steps to insert or delete a node to keep your chain sane.\n",
    "- Mind border conditions, i.e, empty list, head, or tail?\n",
    "- The design of our implementations has an extra class: `SLinkedList`, which organizes the `Node` objects together into an SLL. The textbook uses only one Node class (`IntNode`, to be exact), which uses minimal information, is beautiful in its own way, and works well with recursive algorithms. Make sure you understand it and compare it with the 2-class design (e.g., design complexity, performance of some operations, and which one is more of canonical [OOD](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ood-principles-solid/)?\n",
